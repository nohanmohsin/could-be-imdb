# I mean it could be Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

I learnt some stuff making this thing....one of them was imposter syndrome is real and I cant write css :')
(send help)

### The api I used

https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api I used their api cos of no rate limiting(but there is still a rate limiting section in the docs even tho they dont rate limit anymore Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯) https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction is the docs link 

at first I wanted to use a wrapper for their api (yes, they have lotsa wrappers for all kinds of languages!) but then I realised it was a bit of an overkill

### why not imdb's api?

cos it's an undocumented api ðŸ˜‘

### what did I really learn from this project

probably writing better comments and the fact that my css game is pretty bad and I am gonna try to improve it...gonna learn some sass and other stuff from kevin powell :) will make a repo for the css projects

### hardest part of this project

hardest part of this project was too not watch all the cool movies and shows that I was seeing in the website XD
#### thanks for reading :3
